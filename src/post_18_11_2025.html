                Hello world!
            </h2>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">
                To what purpose am I writing? Why do I want to write?
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                For the majority of my life, I have found myself plagued with questions that I imagine most people are perturbed by. What am I doing? What am I? What is my purpose? Being some of them. I imagine, if anyone shares my temperament you have found yourself after the long ghastly sigh of time left with nothing in your arms to sufficiently answer these questions. That is, after much thought and action, you are still left feeling empty, still left feeling that you haven't answered any of these questions, and therefore, left feeling entirely devoid of purpose; entirely unable to point to why your existence matters.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">
                Troubled by this, I have done many things that have tamed the urges to outwardly produce my inner world into creation and have found myself emptier than ever. From perversion of lust, to gluttonous gorges, to endless consumption of content, to the obliteration of mind with whatever substance you can get your hands on. Each offered me pleasure, but always left me unsatisfied. And now, after habituating all of these vices, not only do I contend with the uncertainty of my own existences, I am left to battle the savages of these vice in order to make sure they are not a reoccurring theme of my life and to assure that the vestiges of their consequences do not mold my face into a disfigured abomination caused by an accumulation of bad decision making.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                So why do I write now, what Am I seeking. Well, I am seeking to know myself, and one of the ways in which I believe I can accomplish this goal is through expression, creation, the arts. I seek to create something rather than always being a passive consumer. I seek to be the active agent for my own life rather than a bystander that is watching its light dwindle away.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">
                Of course I have many hesitations about this. By no means am I exceptional in writing, nor do find myself to be gifted with creative genius. I am rather simple, I am rather raw, I am a stone of marble that has stood still exposed to the elements chipping away its material while yearning for an artist to come cultivate it into something greater. Of course, there can be no other artist for ones own fate other than you, yourself. I am that artist even if that artist is unrefined and stupid.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                So again, why am I writing, what am I trying to do here? I am here not declaring that these written entries are the meaning in which everything in my life has lead up to. No, I am here because I am choosing to be here. I am here taking a leap of faith which is, that even someone ordinary and unexceptional like me can still forge meaning within his own art. And the means of doing so, I believe, is being able to authentically express yourself, being able to create an outward manifestation of ones own being. I would like to do that here. I would like to embark on this adventure and write whatever I want in hopes that I can unravel my own being (knowing myself) and slowly forge my own meaning (purpose) even when I'm completely unsure if this has any meaning to begin with and even when I am in absolute doubt of my ability to create anything worthwhile.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">
                I do have some naïve goals in mind as well. It would be nice if people that are similar to me were inspired in some fashion in which they took up arms for their own being and sought to forge meaning against the tyranny of oblivion. It would be nice if the masks that we all wore began to slip of our face and we can meet people truly. It would be nice to blossom new connections and new experiences even from a tiny little sapling that I'm regarding this project to be. It would be nice  to curate a semblance of belonging and understanding for people rather than contributing to our already profound alienation and incomprehension of one another. It would be nice to help cultivate better thoughts, actions and virtues in people and help restore belief that these things really do matter. It would be nice to leave some sort of impression upon this world and just see how tall a little sapling can grow and how far its branches can reach. It would be nice to produce some fruit in which new seeds can be born, isnt that legacy after all? Not forever being admired by those to come, but leaving structures behind that will always aid those after us in growing.

            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                By no means am I exceptional, by no means am i creative, and perhaps, maybe this isnt me being honest and true to myself at all, but a farce that satisfies my own vanity. I do not know, ALl is uncertain ahead of me, but what is certain is my yearning for purpose, expression, knowing myself, and connection. 
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                So here i am,  My medium for creation will be writing, and I will write whatever. I will write random thoughts, I will write random occurrences, I will write about ideas and Ill probably do this all very poorly, but at the very least, I would like to say that I wrote truly, that I wrote in accordance to my inner world, even if that world isnt sophisticated or grand like others.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                It cant be the case, that the only things worth being produced in this world are from exceptional people. I don't believe that. I believe there are great things that can origin from those that may be average, but dared to try and really put the effort behind ones boldness. 
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                What dreams may come holds true. But there is almost something insipidly implicit in that statement. Its almost if dreams can only come at you but never from you. I want my dreams to be realized and I want to in part realized them through my owwn will and means
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 text-teal-800">    
                So here we are. This is my first step in trying to create something and hopefully, with enough attention and effort, I too can cultivate a beautiful tree for this world
